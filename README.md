## Event Details

What is this workshop about?

Content mining technologies hold much potential for maximising scientific discovery and the reuse of research through automated searching, indexing and analysing of scientific literature. This workshop aims to educate and engage technologists and biologists who are interested in using mining technologies for synthetic biology to better enable access to research literature and data in plant synthetic biology.

Target Audience:

The workshop is best suited to biologists and bioinformaticians who have, to some degree, experience of using command line tools or at the very least enthusiasm to pick this up! As such, formal programming experience is not a requirement, but you may find it useful to attend the Software Carpentry Workshop being held at TGAC prior to this event. The two events are back-to-back in order to make accommodation and travel logistics easier for those that wish to attend both training events. For more information see here.

Prerequisites:

Basic prior knowledge of programming concepts. See what is covered in our Software Carpentry Workshop in case this might be useful for you to attend also. Please contact the organisers if you have any questions about this!


## Schedule

### Workshop - Day 1

Training Workshop - Day 1 (11:00-18:00 followed by dinner)

This day is designed to get everybody up to speed with the process of content mining and introduce the ContentMine pipeline in advance of the hackathon. The software will involve use of the command line and is still in development mode so come ready to explore and prepared for some things to fail.

#### Schedule for DAY 1 - 10 MARCH 2016

| Time |	Topic |
|------|--------|
| 11:00-11:30 |	Introduction |
| 11:30-11:45 |	How to work with ContentMine tools |
| 11:45-12:30 |	Building a corpus with getpapers |
| 12:30-13:30 |	Lunch |
| 13:30-14:00 |	sHTML and normalization |
| 14:00-16:00 |	Extracting facts with AMI - species and regular expressions |
| 16:00-17:00 |  Facts in context with Jupyter notebooks |
| 17:00-18:00 |  Exploring and proposing hackathon projects |

#### Schedule for DAY 2 - 11 MARCH 2016

The second day is an open format focussed on group work and concrete projects with the aim to explore applications of content mining.

Our hackathon aims to improve searching and indexing of plant synthetic biology texts through open source technology platforms developed by the Grassroots Genomics (http://www.tgac.ac.uk/grassroots-genomics) project at TGAC and the ContentMine (http://contentmine.org/) platform from the University of Cambridge.

We want to tailor these services to find and analyse plant-focused and synthetic biology terms and journals. Examples of projects could be :

* Extracting information from synthetic biology journals by writing custom web scrapers
* Writing custom parsers for common types of terms or data e.g. BioBricks and parts from synthetic biology registries.
* Sectioning documents to search for terms only in the results or methods sections of papers, or particular species or varieties, e.g. “Chinese Spring wheat”
* Extending the Grassroots Genomics infrastructure to take advantage of data scraped from the synthetic biology literature and linking this to other indexed datasets.

You are free to bring your own ideas and come up with more on the day! The event is designed to generate ideas, rapid prototypes and collaborations so we don’t expect fully functioning demos but at the end of the day there will be a chance to present where you’ve got to and make plans to take forward promising projects.
